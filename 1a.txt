Creating and managing vector data: Adding vector layer, setting properties, formatting, calculating line length and statistics.

Set the name and location of file. Select geometry type as polygon. Add new field as Name and click on Add to field list button.
Click Toggle Editing Button → then Click on Add Polygon; Now place the cursor at the location where you want to place the polygon. For polygon layer minimum 3 points should be selected. Give id and Name to the polygon.
To change the property of layer right click on layer matunga from Layers pane and select Properties...
Similarly add one more layer garden and add polygons to represent garden, also provide id and Name of each polygon being created.

Repeat the same steps as we have done for polygon layer. ➢ Select geometry type Line.
To plot road click on Add Line Feature.
Click on the map where you want to draw line. Once you are done then right click on map (Dotted line turn into solid line).

To merge roads go to properties of road then select symbology. Click on Advanced button select Symbol levels.
Check Enable symbol levels option and click on OK.
